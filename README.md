ABSTRACT<br/>
Compressive sensing provides an eﬃcient method to recover sparse high dimensional signals from low dimensional observations. One of the most important concern in compressive sensing is the high degree of correlation in sensing matrices. Sparse signal recovery has wide applications in source localization, radar detection etc. and in many of these applications, the dictionary matrix is highly coherent. This work numerically compares the eﬃciency of various sparse recovery algorithms in reconstructing the signal when the design matrix has highly correlated columns. This work also demonstrates the advantages of applying post processing techniques like SWAP algorithm to improve the performance of traditional algorithms like LASSO.<br/>
The results are available in the file titled experimental-study-compressive.pdf
