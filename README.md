# HighlyCoh-CS
This project contains the results of implementing Compressive sensing algorithms for sparse signal recovery when the sensing signal is highly coherent.
The algorithms considered incude:
1.LASSO
2.OMP
3.TMSBL
4.FBMP
5.BCS
6.ExCoV
Addditionally the results of the algorithm was also post processed using SWAP algorithm
