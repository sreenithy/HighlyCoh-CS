# HighlyCoh-CS
This project contains the results of implementing Compressive sensing algorithms for sparse signal recovery when the sensing signal is highly coherent.<br/>
The algorithms considered incude:<br/>
1.LASSO<br/>
2.OMP<br/>
3.TMSBL<br/>
4.FBMP<br/>
5.BCS<br/>
6.ExCoV<br/>
Addditionally the results of the algorithm was also post processed using SWAP algorithm
