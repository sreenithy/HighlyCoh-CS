# HighlyCoh-CS
This project contains the results of implementing Compressive sensing algorithms for sparse signal recovery when the sensing signal is highly coherent._
The algorithms considered incude:_
1.LASSO_
2.OMP_
3.TMSBL_
4.FBMP_
5.BCS_
6.ExCoV_
Addditionally the results of the algorithm was also post processed using SWAP algorithm
